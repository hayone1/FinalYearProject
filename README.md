# SmartHome.Net
SmartHome.Net is an IoT project to enable a smartHome using Azure cloud services, arduino, Raspberrypi and .Net 5. proteus

# Contents
This repository contains the following:
- Unity3d project files used to build the client application.
- RaspberryPi device-side project files.
- Arduino sketches used to control and automate arduino devices.
- detailed UML sequence diagram and use case diagram to illustrate programs' execution sequence.
- [optional] Proteus Files with arduino circuit setup, simulation ready.
- The unity project can be found at 

# Features
- Monitor and Control relay connected lights and servo controlled door.
- Identify intruder and alert client using sensors and conditionals based on if client is home, away or asleep.
- Facebook SSO login authentication and device authorization as an extra layer of security.
- Alert client of unwanted conditions such as high temerature or humidity.
- Alerts are sent to client by mail and SMS .
- Provide graphical visualization of operating conditions in the home.
- Allow client set the home into "home", "away", "sleep" and "awake" modes preset modes.

# Prerequisites

## Hardware Requirements
The project code can be edited to add or remove certain hardware needs but the list of hardware devices used in the project are included in the *Requirements* docx within the **FlowCHarts** folder.

## Software Requirements
The software reqirements can also be seen in the *Requirements* docx. It is important to take note of the software components that are optional and replaceable and those that are not.

## **Important**
For the RaspberryPi to communicate with the right Arduino at all times, the Rpi port should be assigned permanent/fixed labels and the Arduino USB connection ports should not be changed afterwards.

Detailed steps on how to achieve this can be found in this freva site [here](https://www.freva.com/assign-fixed-usb-port-names-to-your-raspberry-pi/)

# Testing
Certain important edits will need to be made to the project to achieve successful build and test scenarios.
The edits include:
- Every occurrence of a connection string. This can be gotten from Azure whenever you create a storage type or a reprsentation of a device in the cloud.
- Every occurrence of an API access token. This can be gotten from API details of the associated Azure resource or Facebook resource(eg. Azure Function API key).

# Building
To successfully build this project, ensure to follow the instructions of the prerequisites and testing section.
